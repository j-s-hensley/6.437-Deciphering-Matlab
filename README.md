## 6.437 : Deciphering with Metropolis Hastings
Decrypting a Substitution Cipher
Author: Sarah Hensley

A [simple substitution cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher) is a way of encoding a message, in which each character of plaintext is replaced with some other character. This project decrypts the resulting ciphertext using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. This is my original version of the project, written in MATLAB. A more updated version, with a more thorough description, can be found at https://github.com/j-s-hensley/6.437-Deciphering.
